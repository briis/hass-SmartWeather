This a *Custom Integration* for [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/). It combines real-time weather readings from a Personal Weather station produced by *WeatherFlow* and Forecast data also from Weatherflow. It uses the public [REST API](https://weatherflow.github.io/SmartWeather/api/swagger/) to pull data from Weatherflow.

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

* Weather
* Sensor

Forecast data can be delivered as *hourly* or *daily* data.
